Nordic Art Club is a group of people that meet up to play [art games](/art-games/) and draw together with a side of coffee ‚òï and cake üç∞. We sit in cozy caf√©s or find a sunny spot in the park during the 3.6 days of summer we get in Sweden and Denmark.

**Everyone is welcome**, whether you're a professional artist or a stick figure afficionado. You can find us here:

- _Art Club Online (Discord)_
