Nordic art club is a group of people that meet up to play [art games](/art-games/) and draw together with a side of coffee ☕ and cake 🍰. We sit in cozy cafés or find a sunny spot in the park during the 3.6 days of summer we get in Sweden and Denmark.

**Everyone is welcome**, whether you're a professional artist or a stick figure afficionado. You can find us here:

* [Copenhagen Art Club](/copenhagen-art-club)
* [Gothenburg Art Club](/gothenburg-art-club)
* _Art Club Online (Discord)_
